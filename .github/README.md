# Fusion Vision

A real-time object detection system with voice narration capabilities. The aim is to create a Social Media Platform for the visually impaired where they can upload their photos and get the description of the image in voice. Also they can share their photos with their friends and family and checkout the photos from others and know the updates of their surroundings.


## Features

- Real-Time Object Detection: Utilizes Coco-SSD (TensorFlow.js) for live object detection.
- Voice narration of detected objects
- Web-based interface for easy access
- Unique Social Media Platform for the visually impaired
- Unique profiles and verified users
